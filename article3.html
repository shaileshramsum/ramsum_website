                <section id="what-is-generative-ai">
                    <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
                    <p>Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence techniques that enable machines to generate new content, images, text, or other forms of data autonomously. Unlike traditional AI models that are designed for specific tasks, generative AI models are trained on large datasets and learn to mimic and create new content that resembles the patterns and characteristics of the data they were trained on.</p>

                <section id="key-concepts">
                    <h2>Key Concepts and Techniques</h2>
                    <p>Neural Networks: Generative AI models are typically based on deep neural networks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These networks learn to generate new data by analyzing and synthesizing patterns from existing data.</p>
                    <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP): In the domain of text generation, generative AI models use NLP techniques to understand and generate human-like text. Applications range from chatbots and virtual assistants to automated content creation and language translation.</p>
                    <p>Computer Vision: Generative AI has made significant strides in computer vision tasks, including image synthesis, inpainting (reconstructing missing parts of images), and style transfer. This enables applications in creative industries, medical imaging, and autonomous systems.</p>
